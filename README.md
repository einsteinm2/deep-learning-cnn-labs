# CNN Experiments with PyTorch

This repository contains simple and clean CNN implementations using PyTorch and Skorch.

The goal is to understand how convolutional neural networks work by starting with small and structured projects

## What you'll find here

- CNN model definitions
- Training with Skorch
- Learning rate scheduling
- Evaluation on test set
- Classification report
- Confusion matrix
- Clear and minimal code structure

## Current Projects

- MNIST digit classification
